    Adulthood&#39s End Hypothesis (Or how environments dictate maturity)
</p>
<hr>

<div class="blog_entry"> 
    <p>
        I hypothesize that adult human beings can be reduced to a state of childhood-ness (displaying traits associated by children) by putting said adults in an environment in which they are treated like children. How does one treat an adult like a child? By removing that human’s rights and responsibilities. Allegorically: A liquid will morph its shape to fill the container which it is poured into.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I will expand on the contrast between children and adults. I define adults not based upon their years but upon themselves. An adult has significantly more rights and responsibilities than a child. An adult must do work on his environment to acquire what he wants; a child does nothing and events that others have chosen for him are thrust before him. A child ostensibly goes to sleep when he is told and when he doesn’t go to sleep when instructed, he is reprimanded for his actions. An adult goes to sleep when she/he feels like it and he is accountable to nobody. A child eats what he is given and when it is prepared for him. An adult must make or purchase his meal and he has the freedom to purchase whatever ingredients or meal that he is capable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, I tout the transition from childhood to adulthood is not a pokemon-esque evolution where massive physiological and psychological changes occur at a singular point when a human levels up to eighteen, but is rather progressive and slow evolution as the child is exposed to conflict. By conflict, I do not automatically gravitate to such lofty epics as wars or starvation or the Odyssey, but I define a conflict as the need for an individual to do work onto a system in order to receive a desired output; said system will not automatically provide for the individual. Referring back to the cooking example, a child has no conflict with eating. He watches telly and his parents call him over once they have prepared dinner for him. Next, they turn off the telly and drag him over when he doesn’t come the first time. An adult however, can sit in front of his television until the heat death of the universe and nobody will cook for him. He is his own responsibility and must overcome this conflict (I am hungry and I need to eat or else I die). Additionally, adults can be alluded to as chess players who plan a few moves ahead while children are playing checkers and not paying any heed to what will happen in the future, just thinking exclusively in the present tense. A child doesn’t care if it is his bed time, he wants to watch cartoons and does not realize (or care) that if he does not go to sleep on time, he will be very tired tomorrow. Consequently, an adult will idyllically forgo purchasing a needlessly expensive automobile in order to save money for his or her eventual retirements. An adult sacrifices joys in the present for a greater return in the future.
    </p>
    <p>   
        Thus, one can infer that many adults are in fact, still children (they never grew up) and a few children should be granted the title of adult based upon how they act. But I will expand upon this idea and say that adults can also be reduced to a temporary state of childishness by putting them in an environment which a) reduces their rights and b) reduces their responsibilities. By placing adults in an environment like this, it will lead to more childlike behavior: irrational egocentrism, histrionics, judging the value of others based upon emotions instead of reason, bitterness when another covets their toy, ect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, I argue that large bureaucratic organization (corporate America, for example), contains this paradigm of reducing the rights and responsibilities of its denizens in its design schematics. When an adult is at home, he/she is free to do essentially what he/she wants. When he is slaving away for the man at the office, the rights and responsibilities of an individual are focused on a very narrow scope (that is to say, his job) and that individual cannot exert any influence outside of this scope (outside of scope being the jobs and responsibilities of others). This environment (along with another other environment that reduces rights and responsibilities), I hypothesize, will induce childish behavior in most people contained inside it. I also hypothesize that certain individuals who are granted (or take) a greater degree of autonomy in their duties than others are less likely to exert these traits of childhood-ness.

    <p>
        Granted, I could also be completely wrong.
