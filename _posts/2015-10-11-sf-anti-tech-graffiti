In the last couple of months, since I've moved to San Francisco, I've noticed various instances of street graffiti and signs that demonstrate negative feelings towards high tech workers in San Francisco.

It's no secret that tech workers in the city have a higher income than the average resident and the limited housing (low supply) and San Francisco's desirability as a city (high demand) means gentrification is a very real concern of many residents.

A few weeks ago, I was walking down Bryant Street in SOMA and saw a few people protesting with a mehaphone and signs in front of the Hall of Justice.
