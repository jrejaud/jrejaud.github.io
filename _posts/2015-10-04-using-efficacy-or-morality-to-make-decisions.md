title:  "Using Efficacy or Morality to make a decision"

When deciding whether to attempt an action or not, one should take into account both the **[efficacy][efficacy_def]** and the **[morality][morality_def]** of that action. 

One should only attempt an action if it is both:
 
1. Effective (the action will help you accomplish a goal) 
and 
2. Moral (whether the action is morally justified).

In the complicated world that we live in, it isn't always obvious to us what the efficacy or the morality of our actions are. 

I think **efficacity** can be predicted by using things like the scientific method and having a data driven approach to problem solving.  

I think **morality** can be deduced by using rational thinking.

If you cannot convince yourself that your action is both effective and moral, you are stuck until you acquire a **yes** for both requirements.

However, I think it is possible to make a decision of whether one should attempt an action (or not) even with missing data.

Going off the assumption that you should only attempt an action that it is both effective and moral, and that these conditions are not always known, one can construct the following table:

####Should I attempt an action?

|                  | Moral  | Immoral | Morality Unknown |
|:----------------:|:------:|:-------:|:----------------:|
| Effective        |  Yes   |   No    |     Maybe        |
| Ineffective      |  No    |   No    |   No       |
| Efficacy Unknown |  Maybe |  No  |     Maybe       |

<br>

One can see two interesting cases in this table: 

1. Action is Immoral and Efficacy is unknown  
2. Action is Effective and Morality is unknown

If you can't conclude the Efficacy of an action, but you **can** conclude that it is Immoral, then you **shouldn't attempt it**. It doesn't matter how effective an action is if you think its immoral (granted, morality could be a function of efficacity, but that's for a different blog post).

If you can't conclude the Morality of an action, but you **can** conclude that it is Ineffective, then you **shouldn't attempt it**. It doesn't matter how moral an action is if it simply isn't effective.
