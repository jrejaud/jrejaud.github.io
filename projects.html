            <p>
                For a class project, the entire class had to collaborate and build a 6 degree of freedom robotic prosthetic arm.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               My team built a three degree of freedom upper arm and shoulder which is connected to the elbow and the plastic "backpack" that the user wears.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The upper arm and shoulder is made out of aluminium and carbon fibre. It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowden_cable">bowden cables</a> for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TioVD_ElpPA">flexion/ extension and abduction/ adduction</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also uses an AC motor for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TioVD_ElpPA">medial rotation/ lateral rotation</a>. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
               The arm is controlled by motors on the back (not seen in the picture) and could ostensibly grab an object the size of a soda can. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e53UZG6arjE">Song Credits</a>

        <p>
            Capstone project for my Aerospace Engineering Minor at Lehigh University was to build an aircraft.
        </p>
        <p>
            This roadable aircraft can also drive around on the ground. It is build primarely out of wood with foam wings and metal struts to support the wings.
        </p>
        <p>
            This plane had two motors inside it (one to power the prop and one to power the front wheels)
        </p>
        <p>
            It flew very successfully on the second attempt. The first time, <del>I</del> we forgot to balance the weight of the aircraft properly and it crashed nose first after ~a minute.
        </p>
        <p>
            So we built a second one two days before the deadline. The initial plane had taken a few months to make. Only time that I ever pulled an all-nighter for school.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had a lot of fun building this plane and kept the schematics so I could build another one in the future.

            Automatic Targeting Frisbee Launcher. This machine uses a camera to automatically aim for the colored target that you selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            It uses a very powerful DC motor to induce linear and rotational motion of the frisbees and shoot them at the target.
        </p>
        <p>
            A servo motor ostensibly pushed the little frisbees out of the <del>dirty tin coffee can</del> frisbee containment tower and towards the DC motor.
        </p>
        <p>
            A planetary gear is used to line up the launcher horizontally and a linear actuator lines it up vertically.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did a little of the code but mostly worked on the body and mechanics.

        <p>
            By using a Microsoft Kinect and an LED Cube, you can point the camera at a very crude object and recreate it in 3D space!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The resolution of your created object is limited by the number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">Voxels</a> (3D pixels) that your camera can see or your LED cube can generate.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In this situation, the LED Cube used is 4x4x4; so it only has 16 Voxels and can only recreate very simply shapes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you have a massive LED Cube (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1YNyQqbiF0">32x32x32 or 32768 voxel cube</a>), you can make very high quality holograms.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Unfortunately, I didn't have an unlimited budget; this entire project was wired and coded (in Processing) in four days for <a href="http://build18.org/">Build18</a>, an Electrical Engineering Hackathon at Carnegie Mellon.

        <p>
            We built a prototype sensing mechanism for this gravity simulator. The gravity offloading cord must always be on top of the object that you are simulating moon level gravity on. Thus, if the object moves, the cord must move at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our sensing mechanism detects the angle offset of the object and sends commands to the tether cord to move it back on top of the object. The video should explain this better.

        <p>
            Eagles can pick up their prey and fly away with it. If an eagle can do this, why not a UAV? I built a robotic claw that automatically aims at nearby objects and grabs then when it gets close.
        </p>
        <p>
            The claw uses two infared sensors on either side to see if an object is close and a DC motor to automatically aim the claw towards the object. It then uses a touch sensor to automatically close the claw around an object.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone told me the idea of a UAV with claws to grab objects and fly around with said objects was stupid, but a few years later <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011">Amazon had a similar idea</a>...

        <h2>Robotic Eel</h2>    
        <p>
            I decided that a robotic eagle claw was not cool enough (see above project) so next semester I made a robotic eel for a micro-nano robotics course.
        </p>
        <p>
            My team's main project was to design a micro scale robotic fish. Given that we didn't have the resources to accomplish this, I build a much larger prototype to demonstrate how our fish/eel robot would work.
        </p>
        <p>
            This robotic eel uses four servo motors in order to simulate the motion of different species of eel. Our final version would of been much smaller and used Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) motors instead of servo motors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program I wrote which controls this robot uses <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1315762&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1315762">this equation</a> to simulate the undulation motion of different species of eels. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This Robotic Eel was the final project for my <a href="http://nanolab.me.cmu.edu/">Micro Nano Robotics Course</a>.

        <p>
            I was studying "Modern Marriage and Polygamy in Mali", as part of my Anthropology minor at Lehigh University.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mali has one of the highest rates of Polygamy (one husband with multiple wives) in the world and it isn't particularly clear why this is and if this trend is going to grow/ shrink in Mali's future.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Malian Military Coup broke out a month after Lucy and I left. I was sad that I wasn't there when it happens, It would of been pretty nuts.
