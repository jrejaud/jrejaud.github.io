        <p>
           My team built a three degree of freedom shoulder for a prostetic arm at Carnegie Mellon. The entire arm has 6 degrees of freedom.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           The arm is controlled by motors on the back (not seen in the picture) and could ostensibly succesfully grab an object the size of a soda can.

            By using a Microsoft Kinect and an LED Cube, you can point the camera at a very crude object and recreate it in 3d space!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This entire thing was wired and coded in four days for <a href="http://build18.org/">Build18</a>, an Electrical Engineering Hackathon at Carnegie Mellon.

        <p>
            Final project for a course was to research the total cost for an object of our choice. For example: What is the total petrol, raw materials, energy, ect needed to acquire all the ingredients, bring them to the factory and make a candy bar?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I figured that was probably going to be super boring so I used the US government's <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/lci/">NREL database</a> and wrote a program in VBA to automate the entire process.

        <p>
            Capstone project for my Aerospace Engineering Minor was to build a roadable aircraft.
        </p>
        <p>
            A roadable aircraft is an aircraft that can also drive around on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            This aircraft had two motors inside it (one to power the prop and one to power the front wheels)
        </p>
        <p>
            I had a lot of fun building it with my team and kept the schematics so I could build another one in the future.

        <p>
            I built a (part of half of a prototype of a) machine which simulates reduced gravity for moon rovers!
        </p>
        <p>
            My team and I built a prototype of the sensing system for this magic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carnegie Mellon took the initial prototype and eventually built this <a href="http://www.astrobotic.com/2013/11/12/astrobotic-releases-video-on-simulating-reduced-gravity/">crazy things.</a>

        <p>
            For my systems engineering course, my team and I built a Phenakistoscope for the Pittsburgh's Childrens' Museum.

            Basically, press a bunch of buttons and a very pretty color sphere will appear!

        <p>
            My team and I built an auto targeting frisbee launcher for our mechatronics design course!
        </p>
        <p>
            I did a little of the code but mostly worked on the body and mechanics.

        <p>
            I built a robotic claw that automatically aims at objects and grabs then when it gets close.
        </p>
        <p>
            I built it using a VEX kit and wrote the code for it in RobotC.

        <p>
            I decided that a robotic eagle claw was not cool enough so next semester I made a robotic eel.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program I wrote which controls this robot uses <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1315762&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1315762">this equation</a> to simulate the undulation motion of different species of eels. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This Robotic Eel was the final project for my <a href="http://nanolab.me.cmu.edu/">Micro Nano Robotics Course</a>.

        <p>
            Lucy Xia and I went to Bamako, Mali in Winter 2011 to serve as Professor Whitehouse's research assistants.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were studying "Modern Marriage and Polygamy in Mali".
        </p>
        <p>
            The Malian Military Coup broke out a month after Lucy and I left. I was angry that I wasn't there when it happens, It would of been pretty nuts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Songs in this video are by Malian Artists which I cannot remember the name of...
