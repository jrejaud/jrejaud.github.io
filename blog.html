<h2>
    Two Scribes (or why computer programming will be a mandatory skill in the future)
</h2>

<p>
    Let us imagine two monks in the middle ages. They are sitting at a table in their monastery.
    We are in a world after the fall of the Roman Empire. The standard denizen of this new, fractured world is illiterate.
    Such burden falls upon the shoulders of monks who can read or write, these monks are scribes.
    Our two characters are such monks who are scribes.
    Any historical inaccuracies in this allegory are to be attributed to contrived anachronistic symbolic resonance.
</p>
<p>
    &quotYou are mad.&quot says the prior monk.
</p>
<p>
    &quotYou lack imagination.&quot retorts the latter, his smile sardonic.
</p>
<p>
    &quotSuch things will never happen in a million years.&quot
</p>
<p>
    &quotAnd why would that be, my friend?&quot
</p>
<p>
    &quotListen, all of the peasants, they come to us to write litters for them.&quot
</p>
<p>
    &quotYes, that is the current way of the world&quot
</p>
<p>
    &quotThey give us a bullion, tell us what they want written down, we write it down and then mail the letter they dictated to us.
    The same letter, I might specify, which is littered with mistakes; in conjunction to lacking writing prowess,
    the peasants can barely speak properly.&quot Stated the prior.
</p>
<p>
    His companion nodded, as if he wanted the prior to fully explain his thoughts before the latter revealed his own logic
    trap to counter the prior’s statement. The prior was oblivious to this, or possibly noted such intricacy and disregarded it in his confidence.
</p>
<p>
    He continued &quotAnd then, when the replies to such writings have arrived we (he gestured to his accomplice and himself)
    read the responses back to the peasants as the commoners, paragon polymaths that they are, also lack in reading ability.
    This is the way of the world, the way it is and the wall it always will be. You are a fool for believing that one day a majority of the peasants will be literate.&quot
    The prior sat back down, confident that he had dislodged the absurd notions his younger counterpart had been prattling about that morning.
    The latter paused for a quarter minute, staring at the prior with frozen, analytical eyes. After his self-prescribed time had been allotted,
    confident that the prior has finished his onslaught, the latter smiled a large toothy grin, a cutpurse revealing the knives underneath his cloak.
    He cleared his throat.
</p>
<p>
    &quotYou misunderstand me, you see. I did not say that the majority of peasants would be literate.&quot
</p>
<p>
    The prior attempted to dull a slight crooked smile from the corner of his lips. This brash one is recanting his words, he will not proclaim what the true meaning of his words are after I have shown him his ignorance thought the prior.
</p>
<p>
    But he latter enlarged his manic grin, the rogue dashed himself upon the constable’s lance.
</p>
<p>
    &quotI said that one day, virtually all peasants will be literate. We will live in a new world, a world where such prowess will be as ubiquitous as breathing. A world where our current rates of illiteracy would be unimaginable!&quot
</p>
<p>
    The guardsman thrust his lance deeper into the thief&rsquos cloak. The prior interrupted &quotThe cost to educate them all will be incalculable.&quot He scrunched his forehead and rotated his glaive. &quotAlso, the peasants are idiots! You cannot teach them anything! They will never learn. Think of the onerous task you had of teaching Lord Wilde’s sons how to read. Do you expect the crown to go through such trouble for all of this land&rsquos children?&quot The cutpurse lay limp on the end of the pole arm. 
</p>
<p>
    &quotYes&quot quietly said the latter. The thief&rsquos arm shot out from the folds of his coat and grabbed the wooden shaft. He slowly pulled himself down the length of the shaft, towards the peace officer. The man at the other end of the lance stared in awe at the self-immolating hubris slowly crawling towards him. &quotAnd while some may indeed fail in their learnings, you are damning the peasants and their potential. They have never been given a chance to better themselves. The great majority of them will learn how to read and write and our nation will gladly pay for the schools to teach them such skills.&quot
</p>
<p>
    &quotMadness!&quot screamed the prior, pounding his fist on the table. &quotYour views are utopic. Most peasants cannot learn anything, they lack the ability. And assuming they do, why are you so sure that such schooling will become a staple?&quot
</p>
<p>
    &quotIt will become both a staple and a requirement. But fear not for our employment my brother. For even in a world of those who are literate, there will be room for skilled writers above the average. For even if all can read and write, there will always be a role for those who can string stories and weave narratives. And those such skills will still belong to the few and not the many.&quot
</p>
<p>
    The constable looked on with curiosity having overtaken anger at the blackguard still slowly limping down his lance towards him. &quotBut how will it become a staple and a necessity?&quot inquired the prior. &quotThe peasants till the land, they have no need of literacy.&quot
</p>
<p>
    The thief was a quarter meter from the man of the law. He looked up, threw his cloak open. His olive wings exposed his secret. The pole arm had not penetrated him, simply caught between his belt and his self. The law man was frozen; he had been so confident with his thrust that he did not feel the lack of resistance on the blade. He looked at the core of the olive wings. Daggers and short swords, the rogue needed to close to gap to use such small weapons upon him. The latter smiled and drew a cruel blade.
</p>
<p>
    &quotMy brother, we will one day live in a world where the peasants will no longer need to till the soil until their bones break. I cannot claim to know what their new occupations will be, but I know that they will nearly all be literate as their new occupations will be highly dependent on their ability to do so. What will this new world be like? I cannot claim to know, I cannot see it from my point in history. I cannot know what this new world will be like, but I know it will be something wonderful.&quot

    <summary>Adulthood's End</summary>
<h2>
    Adulthood’s End Hypothesis (Or how environments dictate maturity)
</h2>
<p>
    I hypothesize that adult human beings can be reduced to a state of childhood-ness (displaying traits associated by children) by putting said adults in an environment in which they are treated like children. How does one treat an adult like a child? By removing that human’s rights and responsibilities. Allegorically: A liquid will morph its shape to fill the container which it is poured into.
</p>
<p>
        First, I will expand on the contrast between children and adults. I define adults not based upon their years but upon themselves. An adult has significantly more rights and responsibilities than a child. An adult must do work on his environment to acquire what he wants; a child does nothing and events that others have chosen for him are thrust before him. A child ostensibly goes to sleep when he is told and when he doesn’t go to sleep when instructed, he is reprimanded for his actions. An adult goes to sleep when she/he feels like it and he is accountable to nobody. A child eats what he is given and when it is prepared for him. An adult must make or purchase his meal and he has the freedom to purchase whatever ingredients or meal that he is capable.
</p>
<p>
        Next, I tout the transition from childhood to adulthood is not a pokemon-esque evolution where massive physiological and psychological changes occur at a singular point when a human levels up to eighteen, but is rather progressive and slow evolution as the child is exposed to conflict. By conflict, I do not automatically gravitate to such lofty epics as wars or starvation or the Odyssey, but I define a conflict as the need for an individual to do work onto a system in order to receive a desired output; said system will not automatically provide for the individual. Referring back to the cooking example, a child has no conflict with eating. He watches telly and his parents call him over once they have prepared dinner for him. Next, they turn off the telly and drag him over when he doesn’t come the first time. An adult however, can sit in front of his television until the heat death of the universe and nobody will cook for him. He is his own responsibility and must overcome this conflict (I am hungry and I need to eat or else I die). Additionally, adults can be alluded to as chess players who plan a few moves ahead while children are playing checkers and not paying any heed to what will happen in the future, just thinking exclusively in the present tense. A child doesn’t care if it is his bed time, he wants to watch cartoons and does not realize (or care) that if he does not go to sleep on time, he will be very tired tomorrow. Consequently, an adult will idyllically forgo purchasing a needlessly expensive automobile in order to save money for his or her eventual retirements. An adult sacrifices joys in the present for a greater return in the future.
</p>
<p>   
        Thus, one can infer that many “adults” are in fact, still children (they never grew up) and a few children should be granted the title of adult based upon how they act. But I will expand upon this idea and say that adults can also be reduced to a temporary state of childishness by putting them in an environment which a) reduces their rights and b) reduces their responsibilities. By placing adults in an environment like this, it will lead to more childlike behavior: irrational egocentrism, histrionics, judging the value of others based upon emotions instead of reason, bitterness when another covets their toy, ect.
</p>
<p>
        Finally, I argue that large bureaucratic organization (corporate America, for example), contains this paradigm of reducing the rights and responsibilities of its denizens in its design schematics. When an adult is at home, he/she is free to do essentially what he/she wants. When he is slaving away for the man at the office, the rights and responsibilities of an individual are focused on a very narrow scope (that is to say, his job) and that individual cannot exert any influence outside of this scope (outside of scope being the jobs and responsibilities of others). This environment (along with another other environment that reduces rights and responsibilities), I hypothesize, will induce childish behavior in most people contained inside it. I also hypothesize that certain individuals who are granted (or take) a greater degree of autonomy in their duties than others are less likely to exert these traits of childhood-ness.
</p>
<p>
Granted, I could also be completely wrong.
