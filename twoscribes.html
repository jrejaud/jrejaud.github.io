            <h1>Two Scribes<br>
            <small>Why computer programming will be a mandatory skill in the future</small>
            </h1>
          
           <p>
                Let us imagine two monks in the middle ages. They are sitting at a table in their monastery.
                We are in a world after the fall of the Roman Empire. The standard denizen of this new, fractured world is illiterate.
                Such burden falls upon the shoulders of monks who can read or write, these monks are scribes.
                Our two characters are such monks who are scribes.
                Any historical inaccuracies in this allegory are to be attributed to contrived anachronistic symbolic resonance.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotYou are mad.&quot says the prior monk.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotYou lack imagination.&quot retorts the latter, his smile sardonic.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotSuch things will never happen in a million years.&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotAnd why would that be, my friend?&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotListen, all of the peasants, they come to us to write letters for them.&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotYes, that is the current way of the world&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotThey give us a bullion, tell us what they want written down, we write it down and then mail the letter they dictated to us.
                The same letter, I might specify, which is littered with mistakes; in conjunction to lacking writing prowess,
                the peasants can barely speak properly.&quot Stated the prior.
            </p>
            <p>
                His companion nodded, as if he wanted the prior to fully explain his thoughts before the latter revealed his own logic
                trap to counter the prior&#44;s statement. The prior was oblivious to this, or possibly noted such intricacy and disregarded it in his confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                He continued &quotAnd then, when the replies to such writings have arrived we (he gestured to his accomplice and himself)
                read the responses back to the peasants as the commoners, paragon polymaths that they are, also lack in reading ability.
                This is the way of the world, the way it is and the wall it always will be. You are a fool for believing that one day a majority of the peasants will be literate.&quot
                The prior sat back down, confident that he had dislodged the absurd notions his younger counterpart had been prattling about that morning.
                The latter paused for a quarter minute, staring at the prior with frozen, analytical eyes. After his self-prescribed time had been allotted,
                confident that the prior has finished his onslaught, the latter smiled a large toothy grin, a cutpurse revealing the knives underneath his cloak.
                He cleared his throat.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotYou misunderstand me, you see. I did not say that the majority of peasants would be literate.&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                The prior attempted to dull a slight crooked smile from the corner of his lips. This brash one is recanting his words, he will not proclaim what the true meaning of his words are after I have shown him his ignorance thought the prior.
            </p>
            <p>
                But he latter enlarged his manic grin, the rogue dashed himself upon the constable&#44;s lance.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotI said that one day, virtually all peasants will be literate. We will live in a new world, a world where such prowess will be as ubiquitous as breathing. A world where our current rates of illiteracy would be unimaginable!&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                The guardsman thrust his lance deeper into the thief&#44;s cloak. The prior interrupted &quotThe cost to educate them all will be incalculable.&quot He scrunched his forehead and rotated his glaive. &quotAlso, the peasants are idiots! You cannot teach them anything! They will never learn. Think of the onerous task you had of teaching Lord Wilde&#44;s sons how to read. Do you expect the crown to go through such trouble for all of this land&rsquos children?&quot The cutpurse lay limp on the end of the pole arm. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotYes&quot quietly said the latter. The thief&#44;s arm shot out from the folds of his coat and grabbed the wooden shaft. He slowly pulled himself down the length of the shaft, towards the peace officer. The man at the other end of the lance stared in awe at the self-immolating hubris slowly crawling towards him. &quotAnd while some may indeed fail in their learnings, you are damning the peasants and their potential. They have never been given a chance to better themselves. The great majority of them will learn how to read and write and our nation will gladly pay for the schools to teach them such skills.&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotMadness!&quot screamed the prior, pounding his fist on the table. &quotYour views are utopic. Most peasants cannot learn anything, they lack the ability. And assuming they do, why are you so sure that such schooling will become a staple?&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotIt will become both a staple and a requirement. But fear not for our employment my brother. For even in a world of those who are literate, there will be room for skilled writers above the average. For even if all can read and write, there will always be a role for those who can string stories and weave narratives. And those such skills will still belong to the few and not the many.&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                The constable looked on with curiosity having overtaken anger at the blackguard still slowly limping down his lance towards him. &quotBut how will it become a staple and a necessity?&quot inquired the prior. &quotThe peasants till the land, they have no need of literacy.&quot
            </p>
            <p>
                The thief was a quarter meter from the man of the law. He looked up, threw his cloak open. His olive wings exposed his secret. The pole arm had not penetrated him, simply caught between his belt and his self. The law man was frozen; he had been so confident with his thrust that he did not feel the lack of resistance on the blade. He looked at the core of the olive wings. Daggers and short swords, the rogue needed to close to gap to use such small weapons upon him. The latter smiled and drew a cruel blade.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quotMy brother, we will one day live in a world where the peasants will no longer need to till the soil until their bones break. I cannot claim to know what their new occupations will be, but I know that they will nearly all be literate as their new occupations will be highly dependent on their ability to do so. What will this new world be like? I cannot claim to know, I cannot see it from my point in history. I cannot know what this new world will be like, but I know it will be something wonderful.&quot
